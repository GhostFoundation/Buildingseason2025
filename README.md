# Buildingseason2025
Ghost foundation Buildingseason repo of 2025

14-01-2025 swervedrive works, fieldorientated works, max velocity is set at 3m/s for training purposes
real max speed is 7.22 m/s

Cameravision.java doesnt work yet work in progress

18-01-2025 implemented apriltag detection in branch: [apriltag-vision-by-Gijs](https://github.com/GhostFoundation/Buildingseason2025/tree/apriltag-vision-by-Gijs)
Decided to not do algea detection since it requires a third camera and we can only get the following info: where is the algea in 2d and how many algea are visible. 
This info doesnt seem too important, will be discussed with others.
